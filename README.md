# Data-Mining-Assignment2
Data Mining Assignment2 for Russel

This is a java project dependant on the weka.jar library to run the data mining algorithms on the Orange Dataset. 
In the Data Mining class, assignment2 requires us to select a Data Set, and choose 3-5 suitable algorithms and run againt the DataSet.

I chose the Orange Dataset, and for easily running the tests on the dataset, I wrote this project to help automate testing. 

This project could be easily updated to run any type of dataset. 

The results are generated in .csv format for easy comparison. 

Happy Mining!
